# Number Equalizer Columns (Java Game) - Alpha
This project is a simple Java game, maths puzzle. Where the user has to match all four Columns, with the same value.

There are two types of games so far, one where it uses “Random Numbers” and another where its given a “Sequence of Numbers”.

It has logic in place to switch to check the Highest and Lowest numbers in the Columns, forcing a number between that range. This allows the game to end at some point.

It’s a text base display, with an easy interface for navigation.

Different game features could be added to this project by building on the classes.
